sheep_wolf_model.py has been set up to run from a command line interface. 

It expects 3 integer parameters: 
								num_of_agents 
								num_of_iterations 
								neighbourhood 
						
								eg python sheep_wolf_model.py 10 100 20
						
Running the model (sheep_wolf_model.py) opens 2 windows ("Figure 1" and "Sheep"). Both windows must be left open. 
In the "Sheep" window select "Run model" from the "Model" dropdown menu to run the model. The sheep are plotted 
with circles and the wolves are plotted by crosses. Select "END" from the "Model" dropdown menu when you are finished, 
and then close the Tkinter window manually if it is still open. This needs to be done for the output files to be created.

A message will pop up saying how many sheep have been eaten and the print output will tell you how many wolves 
there were. An output file called model_data.txt is appended to for each run and will list the time it ran, number 
of agents, number of iterations, number of wolves, and number of sheep eaten. 


Variables you may wish to alter manually at the top of the code:

full_belly - stopping condition. Once all sheeps stores are equal or greater than this amount the model stops. 
no_of_wolves - number of wolves in the model.



The model can only be run once for each GUI.

To use the model within an IDE you can run the version sheep_wolf_model_IDE.py
