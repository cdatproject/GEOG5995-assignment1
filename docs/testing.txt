List of some of the main tests run:

move()
- printed out agents y,x before and after moving

eat()
- printed out agents store before and after eating

web scraping
-Printed out td_xs and td_ys to ensure data scraped correctly from data.html
- compare to data.html

sharing()
-set environment low to ensure sharing
- Printed the x and y value of the 2 agents, their store values before and after
- checked distance within neighbourhood and that stores were both average of the 2 stores

stopping condition
-set stopping condition low to make sure it applied before number of iterations were reached.
-Check agents_stores (in agents_stores.txt) to ensure no stores go over stopping condition
- print hour feature to see how many iterations have occurred
- for low numbers of iterations, it is obvious how many iterations have passed from store amount (approx multiple of 10)

Wolves behaviour
- Fix number of wolves to ensure always enough to chase agent
- Change distance wolves attack agent
	- print x, y coordinates of agent and wolf 
	- print "wolf eats sheep"
	- print number of agents left
	 -print wolfs new (x,y)
-to check traverse printed wolf's coordinate before and after moving

Hour count
- set number of iterations to be several times bigger than 24
- printed out hour count as it looped through and the sheep_eaten variables
- checked sheep_eaten reset to 0 for each 24 iterations

distance_between
-printed 2 agents (y,x) and calculated distance to ensure correct distance returned

property()
- modified getter and setter one at a time to add amounts on to x and y (eg 500)
- created an agent and assigned a variable
- ran get and set on agent.x and agent.y and returned results
- selected just that part of code to run, and see how changes in getter and setter change whilst agent.y and and agent.x remain constant 


General
-Ran model with 0, -1 agents
-Ran model with 0, -1 iterations
-Entered too little/many arguments, or of wrong type when running model 

Visually
- If set high numbers of iterations can see environment getting darker as sheep moves
- can see the wolves eating the sheep if they are close (but not always if they are full)
- can see the wolves traversing the environment
- can see the boundary effect solution worked
- check output is as expected in the 3 output files

note: on one computer notepad was not recognising the \n in model_data.txt output
and outputting the result on one line. On that computer output displayed correctly in notepad ++
